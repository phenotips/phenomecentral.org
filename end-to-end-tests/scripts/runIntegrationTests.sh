# This script does the following:
# 	- Extract zip file for standalone PC instance
# 	- Start the local PC instance. After 30 seconds, pings to check for $READY_MESSAGE.
#	- Start a fake SMTP server (MockMock SMTP)
#	- Run all integration tests (AllTests.xml)
#	- Stop the SMTP and PC instances
#	- Generate an Allure report with the test run results.
