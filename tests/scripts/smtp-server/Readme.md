# Fake SMTP Server - MockMock

`MockMock.jar` is taken from https://github.com/tweakers/MockMock

This provides a fake SMTP service, including a UI for an email inbox that the tests can use. We can move this to a custom maven dependency to pull from github each time if need be. Otherwise, a copy of the jar will remain here which is the easiest solution.
